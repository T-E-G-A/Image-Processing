## Project Overview

This coursework involves multiple image processing tasks designed to demonstrate key concepts and techniques using MATLAB. Each task is broken down into distinct requirements:

### Task Breakdown
#### Part A: MATLAB Training Certificates
- Complete the following MATLAB training courses:
  1. MATLAB Onramp
  2. Image Processing Onramp
  3. Computer Vision Onramp
- Certificates should be submitted as hyperlinks (PDFs are not accepted).

#### Part B: Weekly Quizzes
- Complete 11 self-test quizzes with a score of 12 or higher for each quiz.

#### Part C: Static Image Thresholding
- Isolate the foam finger in an image using multiband thresholding in RGB space.
- Demonstrate the results with a binary image.

#### Part D: Morphological Image Cleaning
- Apply morphological or non-linear filters to refine the binary image from Task C.
- Address false negatives, false positives, and remove noise.

#### Part E: Boundary Annotation
- Annotate the foam finger boundaries on the original RGB image using edge detection techniques.

#### Part F: Centroid and Medoid Calculation
- Calculate and display the centroid and medoid of the foam finger on the annotated image.

#### Part G: Real-Time Webcam Adaptation
- Extend the pipeline from Tasks C-F for real-time use with a webcam.
- Display the foam finger boundary, centroid, and medoid on a live feed.

#### Part H: Real-Time Gesture Recognition
- Implement gesture recognition (up, down, left, right swipes) using real-time webcam input.
- Annotate the live feed with detected gestures and optionally recognize numerical symbols (0-9).
